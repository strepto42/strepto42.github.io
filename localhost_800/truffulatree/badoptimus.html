		<h1>Bad Optimus</h1>
		You are here: <a title='truffulatree.com.au homepage' href="home.html">Home</a> > <a title='Silly things for your amusement' href="silliness.html">Silliness</a> > <a title='A page dedicated to the worst Optimus Prime outfits on the net' href="badoptimus.html">Bad Optimus</a>
<br><br>		
<p>This is a page dedicated to the most atrocious Optimus Prime outfits that Google Image Search can find.</p>
<p>It's quite simple really.</p>
<p><img src="images/optimus/Optimus_Prime.png" width="250" height="243" align="middle">This is Optimus Prime.</p>
<p><img src="images/optimus/optimus_kids.gif" width="200" height="243" align="middle">This... Is not.</p>
<p>It's not that I'm putting down the individuals here - it's obvious that a lot 
	of work and love has gone into the creation of these costumes. I'm sure I couldn't whip up 
	anything as good (well, except maybe for Shithouse Ninja Optimus). It's just 
	that, in part, I'm questioning the rationale of doing it in the first place, and being a cranky old bastard at the same time.<br>
	<br>
	Thanks go to Alan for supplying a couple of awesome new Optimii - if you have 
	a new Optimus to contribute, <a href="contact.html">email me</a>.<br>
	<br>
	P.S. - an update: Thanks to all the various folks who have sent in Optimii. I had no idea there were so many out there, but I suppose
	I should have guessed, given the nature of the Internet. Anyway I've been really <s>lazy</s> busy and haven't loaded them up yet.
	But I promise I will. I will also be loading some decent pictures of the <a href="images/optimus/uberoppie1.jpg">UBER</a> 
	<a href="images/optimus/uberoppie2.jpg">OPTIMUS</a> that <a href="http://www.dansdata.com/" target="_blank">Daniel</a> very kindly gave me.<br>
	<br>
	P.P.S. - another update: <a href="http://www.digi-comic.com/index.php?comicId=79" target="_blank">One good pisstake deserves another, and my mate Nathan has done just that</a>. Not that I mind - being a character in a webcomic is cool!<br>
	<br>
	P.P.P.S. - I'm pleased to report that this page is now the number one Google hit for "Optumus Prime Costume". I promise to put up the Bad Optimus II Page soon!<br>
	<br>
	P.P.P.P.S. - So, who thinks the Transformers movie is going to suck? My money's on not enough robot destruction and waaay to much human crap. We'll see, hey.<br>
	<br>
	Anyway, on with the freakshow.</p>

	<td valign=top class="optimus">This is the sort of thing I'm talking about. Some effort has been gone to - but the execution is 
	really quite terrible. He doesn't even have exhaust pipes - even the kid's 
	drawing above has THOSE. The helmet is nicely shaped, but the eye area lets 
	it down, and I'm not sure what those orange spots on his shoulders are, but 
	I think his parrot has been drinking too much prune juice. I'd mention 
	the groinal area too, but it speaks for itself, and there's worse to come in that department.<br>
	<br>
	The overall effect is that of something you'd normally punch, or inflate with 
	air and jump on. I suppose I should assign a point for sheer solidity.<br>

	really; the head is a trifle large. Apparently this Optimus suffers from an 
	inflated ego.<br>
	<br>
	He also appears to be wearing a miniskirt, which suits his feminine legs and figure. 
	The elbow joints also look a trifle restrictive. I mean, come on, how's he 
	supposed to fight Megatron if he can't even give someone the forks convincingly.<br>

	<td valign=top class="optimus">These next two images form a set. I'm not sure why, but the guy in the Optimus suit 
	reminds me of my cousin, Franz. Eventually Franz will find this page, so let's 
	hope he doesn't kick my arse next time he sees me (which - despite my own Taekwondo 
	endeavours - he would have no trouble doing, having done about 20 years more 
	martial arts training than I have).<br>
	<br>
	Anyway I digress. These costumes are actually quite good. Nice detail, real 
	movable arm joints, actual guns and logos. In fact, I only have three criticisms; 
	1) leave the masks ON guys, 2) Optimus has no wheels, and 3) Megatron is missing 
	his all-important penis-trigger.<br>
