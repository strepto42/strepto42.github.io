Fair enough. Here's my contribution.....

Name: David Chinner

Some things that I remember about JRAHS:

* The teachers that cared about the students and learning
* The acceptance of other people's beliefs and cultures and the ease 
with which we mixed.
* Physics with Mr Bal - top students, cats on skateboards and burning 
magnesium pencil sharpeners.
* The in-depth crowd-based dissection of every question of every test 
taken. 
* The lunch time rush for a computer in the computer room
* The time spent on the farm and growing gigantic vegetables

What I have been doing since JRAHS

* Went to UTS to study Computer Systems Engineering
* Got a job writing programs for industrial control systems
* Spent too much time at the Uni bar having fun and not enough time 
doing assignments or going to lectures. 
* Went to live in Brisbane for a year and work on site installing 
control software I'd written came up. While I was there I decided that 
I did actually want to get my degree because I enjoyed doing that sort 
of work.
* Won a few Tae Kwon Do competitions.
* Started going out with Katy White - we never talked much at school, 
but our paths kept crossing over....
* Finally finished my degree in 2000 and started work full time with 
company I'd now been at for 6 years.
* Went to Europe for 10 weeks with Katy and saw lots of different 
places - everyone should see Norway at least once in their lives. 
* Got a job in Melbourne because I was sick of the job I had, I'm fussy 
about what I want to work on, it was a once in a lifetime opportunity 
and Katy didn't object.
* Bought a lovely old house in Granville with Katy, so we are now
owned by the bank and I'm travelling backwards and forwards between 
Melbourne and Sydney regularly.

My Hopes and Plans for the future

* to have fun
* to do and see interesting things
* [soapbox] "Australia, don't become America."
* [soapbox] That people in power actually give a damn about the 
environment before it is too late, and not just pay lip service when it 
is politically convenient.
* to travel around Australia and to go back to Norway.
* to return to Sydney to be with Katy and appreciate the house we own...

Cheers,

Dave.
